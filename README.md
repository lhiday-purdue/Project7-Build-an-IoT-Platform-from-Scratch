# Project7-Build-an-IoT-Platform-from-Scratch
IITP Summer Program 2021 Project 7

Large-scale IoT is often based on cloud providers such as Amazon, Microsoft, and Google. Though their IoT platforms include the tools to make handling the processes easier, they are often expensive and are difficult to predict the costs for a small IoT implementation. This project will look at the IoT ecosystem and investigate building a system to handle all of the different basic IoT functions, including data storage, analytics, etc.
